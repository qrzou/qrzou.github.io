## About Me

I am currently a research assistant at <a href="https://www.cogai4sci.com/">CogAI4Sci</a>, National University of Singapore,
mentored by <a href="https://www.cogai4sci.com/index.html">Prof. Dianbo Liu</a>.
Before that, I was mentored by 
<a href="https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1080/3178.htm">Prof. Xiangyang Ji</a>
and <a href="https://yxu71.github.io/">Prof. Yi Xu</a> as a reasearch assistant at <a href="https://www.bnrist.tsinghua.edu.cn/bnristen/index.htm">BNRist</a>, <a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/">Tsinghua University</a>.

<br><br>
I received my master degree in 2022 from <a href="https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/index.htm">Department of Automation</a>, <a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/">Tsinghua University</a>, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1080/3178.htm">Prof. Xiangyang Ji</a>. My research interests lie in generative models and representation learning, where I am fascinated by the possibilities for groundbreaking applications that can truly transform our world.
<!-- and their applications which have the potential to change our lives. I am also interested in the cutting-edge intersection of machine learning and multiple modalities. -->
<br><br>
My previous research has focused on unsupervised segmentation and text-to-motion synthesis, with the aim of reducing human efforts and improving learning efficiency.


## Research Interests

<!-- - **Computer Vision:** image recognition, image generation, video captioning
