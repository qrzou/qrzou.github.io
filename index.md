## About Me

I am currently a research assistant at <a href="https://www.bnrist.tsinghua.edu.cn/bnristen/index.htm">BNRist</a>, <a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/">Tsinghua University</a>.
<br>
I received my master degree in 2022 from <a href="https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/index.htm">Department of Automation</a>, <a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/">Tsinghua University</a>, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1166/2066.htm">Prof. Xiangyang Ji</a>. My research interests lie in generative models and representation learning, where I am fascinated by the possibilities for groundbreaking applications that can truly transform our world.
<!-- and their applications which have the potential to change our lives. I am also interested in the cutting-edge intersection of machine learning and multiple modalities. -->

## Research Interests

<!-- - **Computer Vision:** image recognition, image generation, video captioning
- **Machine Learning:** meta-learning, incremental learning, transfer learning -->

- **Computer Vision & Machine Learning:** generative models, representation learning, multi-modality, image segmentation, image manipulation, 

## News

- **[Dec. 2022]** Our paper about unsupervised foreground-background segmentation based on GAN is accepted to AAAI 2023 (Oral).
- **[Oct. 2021]** Our paper about learning foreground-background segmentation from improved layered GANs is accepted to WACV 2022.
